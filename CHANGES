14DEC97 -- version 1.5

- 6x86_reg now also displays two bogoMIPS readings: the kernel-calculated
  bogomips from/proc/cpuinfo, and an independently-calculated bogomips reading.

- Note that bogoMIPS are *NOT* a benchmark or a test for CPU performance; they
  are just a very good indicator of whether the BIOS has correctly configured
  the 6x86 registers and the L2 cache/chipset timing parameters.


03DEC97 -- version 1.4

- 6x86_reg replacement for 6x86_arr (now dumps relevant 6x86 registers
  in human-readable format).
- DOS support was dropped.
- A short, simple kernel patch is included.
- With Mike Jagdis' permission, a new documentation file Doc-6x86.txt was
  included with this release of set6x86. It does not replace the relevant
  Cyrix and IBM Application Notes and Data Books, which one should read
  anyway to get a better understanding of the 6x86 family of CPUs.
- New maintainer: Andrew D. Balsa <andrewbalsa@usa.net>.


14SEP97 -- version 1.3

- 6x86_arr added (dumps Address Region Registers in human-readable format)


29OCT96 -- version 1.2

- "-c" and "-s" options for bit-setting and bit-masking.
- silent mode changed so that get6x86reg outputs HEX-only
  (otherwise it's pretty useless).
- silent mode renamed to "-p" (pipeable output)
  for compatibility with "setVGAreg".
- fatal command line parameter errors now exit instead of
  dumping core...
- DOS version now uses the DOS cross-compiler from DJGPP.


10OCT96 -- version 1.1

- some documentation updates.
- DOS version added (DJGPP compiled) + docs
- silent mode (no output).


05AUG96 -- version 1.0

- initial release. Hacked up from "setVGAreg", which 
  is part of SVGATextMode.
